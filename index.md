## **Who I Am as a _Person_**
I'm Jackie and I'm interested in mobile tech. Lately, I've been very interested in innovative phone designs, such as the folding phones that Samsung has released in recent years. I'm also interested in wearable technology. I also enjoy traveling to different countries and while I was able to travel to a few before the pandemic, there are still many more countries that I would love to visit in the future.

## **Who I Am as a _Programmer_**
As a programmer, I still consider myself a beginner. I'm interested in mobile app development and web development. I enjoy coding with other people and seeing what kind of unique solutions they come up with for different problems. I haven't had much experience programming in the real world, but, as a student completing programming assignments, I try to ~~wait until the last minute.~~
> start early, start often.

I'm also trying to pick up a few programming languages that are relevant to app development. I'm interested in `Swift` and `Kotlin` right now.

## **My Goals**
**Some goals that I want to accomplish soon are:**
- Publishing an app that I've made to the *Google Play Store* or the *Apple Appstore*
- Securing a job in the field of software development
